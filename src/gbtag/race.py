"""Exact evaluation of the reduced AI-race game.

The interaction layer reproduces the repeated two-player race of Fernandez
Domingos and Han (2026): in every round each player chooses Safe (``S``) or
Unsafe (``U``); Unsafe pays more in the stage game and advances the race
faster, but accumulates private setback risk for a race winner.

This module is deliberately *unmodified* with respect to the single-layer
version of the game: the whole contribution of the present study sits in the
identity layer built on top of it (:mod:`gbtag.identity`), where a seat
carries a verifiable or forgeable identity badge and conditions its executed
design on the badge its opponent presents.  Keeping the interaction layer
fixed is what makes the tag effects attributable to the identity layer alone.

The four reduced designs (AS, CS, CAS, AU) are deterministic, so the whole
action path of an ordered pair is fixed once the pair is fixed.  The only
stochastic primitive is the horizon ``T``.  Every matchup is therefore
evaluated by exact expectation over the horizon distribution rather than by
Monte Carlo sampling, which removes simulation noise from the payoff matrix
entirely.
